Darts

1. The libraries required to run the project including the full version of each library
   cv2==4.8.0
   numpy==1.22.4

2. How to run each task and where to look for the output file
   Task 1:
   Script: task1.ipynb
   Function: run all cells from top to bottom, the last one is main which will read the images from Task1/
   will compute the number of darts and the position and will generate the output files
   Output: the output folder is Ilicea_Anca_512/Task1/ and has to be created beforehand

   Task 2:
   Script: task2.ipynb
   Function: run all cells from top to bottom, the last one is main which will read the images from Task2/
   will compute the number of darts and the position and will generate the output files
   Output: the output folder is Ilicea_Anca_512/Task2/ and has to be created beforehand
